# Meanders
Compilation of meander morphometrics from a variety of settings and scales - see Finotello, Durkin, Sylvester (2024), "Meandering Streamflows across Landscapes and Scales:  a Review and Discussion", Geological Society, London, Special Publications, 540(1)

The dataset contains both literature and unpublished data of meander morphometrics spanning five orders of magnitude in meander width and covering a variety of landscapes (alluvial and dryland river, the Gulf Stream, experimental laboratory flumes, lakes, alluvial fans, ridges on Mars, meandering river belts, inactive river and river valleys, submarine turbidity channels, supraglacial meltwater streams, and tidal channels).

The data are contained in a .xls file, and a Matlab code (run on Matlab 2022a) is also provided to reproduce plots reported in Figure 2 in Finotello, Durkin, and Sylvester (2024).
The references for literature data are contained both in the .xls file and in Finotello, Durkin, and Sylvester (2024).
